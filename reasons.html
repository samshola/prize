  <h1>12 Reasons I Love You ❤️</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>A whole year with you… and somehow it still feels like day one. How do you make every moment feel brand new? 💫</li>
    <li>You’re not just my person you’re my calm place in a loud world.</li>
    <li>Sometimes I think about how we started… and I can’t believe how far we’ve come. Do you ever replay our first “I love you”? 💭</li>
    <li>You made ordinary days feel like home. I never realized how safe love could feel until you. 🕊️</li>
    <li>If I could choose again, I’d still find you in every lifetime, in every version of me.</li>
    <li>One year of laughter, late talks, tiny arguments, and holding on anyway. That’s real love, isn’t it? 💗</li>
    <li>You turned my “what ifs” into “I’m sure.” Thank you for being my certainty.</li>
    <li>The first time I tried to approach you, I already knew I had feelings for you. It took me a whole week just to face you, and almost three or four months to count the days until I could finally say it. You were the one who told me, “no matter how bitter it feels, just spit it out.” I was still scared of what would happen if you turned me down, scared of losing something I hadn’t even had yet. But that night, your word gave me courage… and later, when our eyes met that one afternoon, something inside me just knew. That moment when I finally found the strength to ask for your WhatsApp felt like the beginning of everything. 💫</li>
    <li>Before we even really knew each other, just playing that game with you made my heart race in ways I couldn’t explain. I tried to act normal, but inside I was blushing so hard. The way you smiled that day… it felt like a tiny miracle I didn’t know I needed. 🎮💞</li>
    <li>Home stopped being a place the moment it started looking like you.</li>
    <li>You’ve seen every side of me—even the ones I tried to hide—and you stayed. That still makes me want to cry a little.</li>
    <li>One year down, forever to go—but somehow, forever doesn’t feel long enough with you. ❤️</li>
